# Registration-and-Login-system-using-Python-file-handling

The Registration and Login system project is coded using Python. The user credentials are handled by a JSON file (Without Web).

The entire coding is done by using classes and methods, hence if you wanted to run the code try to execute by assigning to any variable for eg. "x = Registration()" in a new cell.

In this project JSON format file is used to handle the user credentials over other file types (txt,Dat,pkl,CSV etc) mainly because 
-The JSON is more secure compared to pickle files. 
-JSON files can be read by using almost any programing languages 

As a beginner in programing (came from the no-coding background) 
Some of the key take away concepts which i learned from this project as a beginner:

-Error handling 
-File handling (Creating, reading and writing a file)
-Operation of dictionary data type (As JSON file format is used for handling the user credentials)
-OOPS concepts -different modules(Json,os,time,re)

Details of this project is uploaded in pdf format Make use of test cases file for running the program

At last I wanted you to try this project by adding extra features like avoiding users to create duplicate User Names, Adding GUI etc..
