# Registration-and-Login-system-using-Python-file-handling

Registration and Login system project is coded using Python. The user credentials are handled by JSON file (Without Web).
The entire coding is done by using classes and methods, hence if you wanted to run the code try to execute by assaigning to any varible 
for eg. "x = Registration()" in a new cell.


In this project JSON format file is used to handel the user credentials over other file types (txt,Dat,pkl,CSV etc) 
mainly because 
-The JSON is is more secure compre to pickle files. 
-JSON files can by read by using almost any programing languages
As a beginner in programing (came from the no-coding background)

Some of the key take away concepts form this project as a beginner:
-Error handling 
-File handling (Creating, reading and writing a file) 
-Operation of dictionary data type (As JSON file format is used for handling the user credentials) 
-OOPS concepts -different modules(Json,os,time,re)

Details of this project is uploaded in pdf format Make use of test cases file for running the program
At last i wanted to You can improve this project by adding extra feature for avoiding users to create duplicate User Names, Adding GUI etc..
